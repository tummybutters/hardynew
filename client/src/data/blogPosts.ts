        question: "How often should I get my car detailed in Sacramento's climate?",
        answer: "Due to Sacramento's intense UV exposure and agricultural dust, we recommend professional detailing every 3-4 months, with ceramic coating for long-term protection against heat and contaminants."
      },
      {
        question: "Will ceramic coating protect against Sacramento's hard water spots?",

        question: "What's the biggest threat to cars in Sacramento?",

        answer: "Ceramic coating provides limited protection against minor scratches but won't prevent rock chips or deeper scratches. For maximum protection, consider combining ceramic coating with paint protection film (PPF) on high-impact areas."

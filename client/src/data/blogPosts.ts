        question: "How long does ceramic coating last in Sacramento's climate?",
        answer: "When professionally applied, ceramic coating typically lasts 2-5 years in Sacramento's climate. The exact duration depends on exposure to elements, maintenance practices, and the specific coating product used."
      },
      {
        question: "Is ceramic coating worth the cost for older vehicles?",
        answer: "Yes, ceramic coating can benefit older vehicles by enhancing appearance, preventing further oxidation, and making cleaning easier. However, vehicles with significant paint damage may require paint correction before coating application."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I wash my car normally after ceramic coating?",
        answer: "Yes, but we recommend using pH-neutral car shampoos and avoiding automatic car washes with harsh brushes. The coating makes washing easier as dirt and contaminants don't bond as readily to the surface."
      },
      {
        question: "Does ceramic coating protect against rock chips and scratches?",
        answer: "Ceramic coating provides limited protection against minor scratches but won't prevent rock chips or deeper scratches. For maximum protection, consider combining ceramic coating with paint protection film (PPF) on high-impact areas."

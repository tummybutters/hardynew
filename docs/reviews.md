- Alyssa Rowe — 1 month ago — “I had a great experience with Ian! I originally booked one car for an interior detail and they were able to come out same day. Upon arrival, I asked if they had the time and resources to detail two other cars for my family. Ian was very accommodating and did an excellent job on all three vehicles.”

## Carousel style (from legacy)
- Two rows of cards scrolling automatically; top row left-to-right, bottom row right-to-left. Each row duplicates its items to make the loop seamless; animation pauses on hover.
- Card size about 320px wide, 280px tall; backgrounds rotate between `#FFB375`, `#FFD7B5`, `#F3F4E6`.
- Neo-brutalist accents: solid black border (`0.5vmin`), chunky box-shadow offset, and slight lift on hover.
- Header shows 5.0 Google rating with star icons and CTA button “See All Reviews on Google”.
- Button styling: background `#EE432C`, black border, chunky box-shadow, uppercase text.

## Animation keyframes
- `@keyframes carousel` moves X from `0` to `-324px * 5` over ~45s, linear infinite.
- `@keyframes carousel-reverse` runs the same distance in reverse for the second row.

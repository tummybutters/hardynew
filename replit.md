## Overview

Hardy's Wash N' Wax is a full-stack mobile car detailing application built with Express.js, React (TypeScript), and PostgreSQL. The application provides a comprehensive booking system for mobile car detailing services in the Davis, California area. The architecture includes a RESTful API backend, React frontend with modern UI components, database management with Drizzle ORM, and integrations with third-party services like Google Sheets, Mailchimp, and mapping services.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system and Radix UI components
- **Build System**: Vite for frontend bundling, ESBuild for server bundling

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **React Router**: Using Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management
- **UI Framework**: Custom component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme configuration
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **API Structure**: RESTful API with Express.js
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL (Neon serverless)
- **Authentication**: Basic setup for user management
- **File Structure**: Modular organization with separate route handlers

### Database Schema Management
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Migrations**: Automated database migrations through drizzle-kit
- **Schema**: Shared schema definitions between frontend and backend

### Third-Party Integrations
- **Mapping Services**: Mapbox for location search and geocoding
- **Email Services**: Multiple email providers (EmailJS, SendGrid)
- **Google Sheets**: Automated booking synchronization
- **Mailchimp**: Email marketing automation
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics 4 integration

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the React frontend
2. **Form Submission**: Booking forms are validated with Zod schemas
3. **API Communication**: Frontend communicates with Express backend via REST APIs
4. **Database Operations**: Backend performs CRUD operations using Drizzle ORM
5. **External Integrations**: Data is synchronized with Google Sheets and Mailchimp
6. **Email Notifications**: Booking confirmations sent via multiple email services

### Booking Flow
1. Location input with Mapbox geocoding
2. Vehicle type selection
3. Service category and add-ons selection
4. Date/time scheduling
5. Customer information collection
6. Payment processing (placeholder for future implementation)
7. Confirmation and external service synchronization
